notes:

november 2, 2022:

-- when we filter through matches, we want to make sure we are pulling sufficient data; therefore strategy will be to continue parsing matches until we hit the alotted matches (20)

-- we will control the filtering by using an index number, offset by how many matches we pull (i.e. index 0 = matches 0->20, index 1 = matches 20->100...)
